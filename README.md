# hop-lean-plugins

This project adds a few plugins to Apache Hop.

## Documentation

The first thing that gets added is the ability to generate documentation of workflows and pipelines.
To make this easy the following was added:

- A new "Documentation" metadata type which allows you to specify what to include in the documentation and where it should end up.
- A new toolbar icon and entry in the File menu which allows you to generate the documentation

TODO: an Action to generate the documentation in a workflow
